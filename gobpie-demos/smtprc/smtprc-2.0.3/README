		SMTP Relay Checker - v2.0.3



What is it?
-----------

SmtpRC is an open relay scanner. It is multithreaded, so can scan
vast networks quickly, fully configurable, and it can output
results in different formats for viewing. It is intended for
Systems Administrators to scan IP blocks under their control.

SmtpRC works by connecting to a mailserver, running through a
series of pre-configured open relay tests and attemtping to
relay mail through each server it checks. When finished
scanning, it will check the mailbox specified for any relayed
emails.


The Latest Version
------------------
The latest version can be downloaded from
http://sourceforge.net/projects/smtprc.


Documentation
-------------

For most up to date documentation, please see
http://www.moejo.co.uk/smtprc-website.


Compilation / Installation
--------------------------

To build SmtpRC please run "make" in the package directory. This
will build the package and create the binary "smtprc". To
install the package, please run "make install".

By Default, the binary will be installed into /usr/local/bin/,
configuration files will be installed
under /usr/local/etc/smtprc/ and all documentation files will be
installed under /usr/local/share/doc/smtprc/. Please see below
for a full list of installed files.

/usr/local/bin/smtprc
/usr/local/bin/gsmtprc
/usr/local/etc/smtprc/auto.conf
/usr/local/etc/smtprc/email.tmpl
/usr/local/etc/smtprc/rcheck.conf
/usr/local/share/doc/smtprc/README
/usr/local/share/doc/smtprc/FAQ
/usr/local/man/man1/smtprc.1
/usr/local/man/man1/gsmtprc.1


Using Smtprc
------------

SmtpRC can be run by specifying options on the command line, or
by configuring an "auto configuration" file and letting SmtpRC
parse the options from there. The latter is recommended.

When SmtpRC is installed, a example "auto configuration" file is
installed in "/usr/local/etc/smtprc/auto.conf". Edit this file,
changing the values to suit your specific network requirements
and run smtprc with the following option (a full list of options
is detailed below): 

"/usr/local/bin/smtprc -j /usr/local/etc/smtprc/auto.conf"

To be sure that a mailserver relays third-party email, SmtpRC
will attempt to relay mail to an address specified. It is
recommended that this address is a mailbox on the local machine
that is being used to run SmtpRC - pop support is a planned
feature, but for now, SmtpRC only supports checking local
mailboxes (mbox and Maildir). Create a new user account
(smtprc), specify the email address for this account, and the
local mailbox (on the command line or in the "auto
configuration" file), and SmtpRC will attempt to relay emails to
this address and check for recieved emails after scanning. 

There is also a GUI interface to smtprc (gsmtprc) that is
installed in /usr/local/bin. This requires Perl Tk to run.


Options:-

Options are shown in two formats; first the command line option
and then the corresponding "auto configuration" option.


-s <ip-range>
IPRANGE:<ip-range>

Specifies the ip range to scan. Smtprc has a powerful notation
that allows you to specify an IP address range using
lists/ranges for each element. Thus you can scan the whole class
'B' network 192.168.0.0/16 by specifying 192.168.*.* or
192.168.0-255.0-255 or 192.168.0-255.*

You can also specify multiple ranges sepreated by ',' For example
"192.168.1.*,172.16.1.*" would scan both ranges 192.168.1.0/24
and 172.16.1.0/24.



-c <config-file>
CONFIGFILE:<config-file>

The config file specified with this option contains a list of
open relay checks to be performed when scanning. The file is
comprised of three columns, each of which is a different check
to be performed on the host being tested (please see the
"Configuration Files" section below for further information). 



-i <path-to-file>
IPLIST:<path-to-file>

This option can be used instead of the -s option. The file
specified should contain a list of hostnames/IP addresses to
scan, sepereated by newlines.



-b <email-address>
RELAYEMAIL:<email-address>

This option specifies the email address that SmtpRC will attempt
to relay to while scanning.



-e <path-to-mailbox>
MBOXMAILBOX:<path-to-mailbox>

This option specifies the (mbox) mailbox that will be checked for
relayed emails after scanning. This should relate to the email
address specied with the -b option (eg: /var/spool/mail/smtprc).



-u <path-to-mailbox>
MAILDIRMAILBOX:<path-to-mailbox>

This option specifies the (maildir) mailbox that will be checked
for relayed emails after scanning. This should relate to the
email address specied with the -b option
(eg: /home/smtprc/Maildir).



-p <number-of-threads>
THREADS:<number-of-threads>

Used to specify the number of threads to use when scanning
(default 1000).



-a
ALLACANS:<Yes|No>

Display results of every scan (even those that passed all tests).



-n
RESOLVEDOMAINS:<Yes|No>

Try to resolve all ip addresses into hostnames.



-m <timeout>
WAITFORMAILTIME:<timeout>

Specify the time in seconds to wait, after scanning, for relayed
mails to arrive (default 60 seconds).



-l <timeout>
CONNECTTIMEOUT:<timeout>

Specify the tcp-connect timeout in seconds (default 30). The
default is normally always ok here. Reduce this figure if you
want to increase scanning speed on a fast network, or increase
it if you are seeing lots of timeouts on a slow network. 



-r <timeout>
READTIMEOUT:<timeout>

Specify the read timeout in seconds (default 30). You may need to
increase this figure if you are on a slow network.



-v
Verbose output. Use twice for greater effect. This is more of a
debugging feature and not recommended for normal use.



-h

Display the help page



-j <path-to-file>
The auto config file contains a list of configuration options for
running SmtpRC can then be run just by specifying the auto
config file with this option. An auto config file can also be
generated with the -k option.



-k <path-to-file> (not yet implemented)
Use this option to generate an auto config file comprised of the
command line options currently being used. smtprc can then be
run using the -j option.




Configuration Files
-------------------

The main configuration file is the checks configuration file
(/usr/local/etc/smtprc/rchecks.conf), specified with the -c
option or the CONFIGFILE: options in the "auto configuration"
file.

This file contains a list of open relay checks to be performed on
each host while scanning. The file is comprised of three
columns, each of which is a different check to be performed on
the host being tested. The first column will be sent with the
"HELO" command, the second column will be sent with the "MAIL
FROM:" command and the third column will be sent with the "RCPT
TO:" command.

example:

If the file contains the line.

"x.x  diceman@dircon.co.uk  diceman@dircon.co.uk"

The following commands will be sent to the server.

"HELO x.x"

"MAIL FROM:diceman@dircon.co.uk"

"RCPT TO:diceman@dircon.co.uk"

The following macros can also be used.

--HOSTNAME-- Represents the domain name of the current server
being checked.

--IP_ADDRESS-- Represents the IP Address of the current server
being checked.

--NAME-- Represents the name part of the email address specified
with the -b option

--DOMAIN-- Represents the domain part of the email address
specified with the -b option.

As long as the format of this file is adhered to then as many
checks as is required can be added to this file.
