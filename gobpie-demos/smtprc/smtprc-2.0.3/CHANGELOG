Added a feature to send an email through the server when
it fails a relay check. As it was possible for false
positives to be displayed.

You can now specify an email address to send the email to with
the -b [email_address] option.

I've also added --NAME-- and --DOMAIN-- options to the config
file. These will be swapped with the name and domain from the
email address supplied with the -b option.

--NAME-- and --DOMAIN-- MUST be used with the -b option and
vise versa.

I still need to add a feture that will automatially check a
mailbox and decide the results based on the emails recieved.
